### Kia ora 👋🏼

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/microbiology/" class="link blue">Section of Microbiology</a> at the <a href="https://www.ku.dk/" class="link blue">University of Copenhagen</a>, Denmark. 

I’m broadly interested in the evolutionary forces shaping life. My work explores how bacteria adapt to the pervasive and dynamic threats posed by mobile genetic elements, such as bacteriophages and plasmids, and how these interactions drive innovation in microbial genomes. Combining molecular and computational biology, my research aims to uncover the mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics underlying these conflicts.
